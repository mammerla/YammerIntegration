This is a set of sample code that can integrate with Yammer.

Yammer/ contains a set of JsonDataContractSerializer-compatible definitions of 
the JSON data structures returned or utilized by Yammer endpoints.

WebForms/ contains some ASP.NET sample controls that do sample Yammer operations.  
At present, these controls aren't really good enough to be used by themselves.

WebForms/YammerWebFormContext.cs is an interesting file that contains some of the 
basics of doing OAuth flow with Yammer.
